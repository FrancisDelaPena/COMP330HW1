COMP 330 Assignment 1: Twitter Unit Testing

Language: Python

2/4/2016 (First Submission): I was ultimately only able to come up with something very basic in terms of a tweet and determining whether it contains hashtags/mentions/urls, but I was able to get unit tests working successfully. 

2/11/2016: Minor updates, cleaned up repo, renamed it.  I understand this is an ongoing project, so I changed the name to reflect it being more than just "Homework #1".  Plans to update with comments/issues in mind.
